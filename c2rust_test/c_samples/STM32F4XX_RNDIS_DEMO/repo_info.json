  "description": "To have platform independent network interfaces over usb which is working with Linux, Windows, Mac OS ect. called RNDIS. This project is a RNDIS demo, which addtionally implements a http server. It runs out of the box on a stm32f411 BlackPill board. My RNDIS library with an empty template for the second interface (which can ba UART, CAN, ETH or like in this demo a tcp/ip stack) can be found under following link: https://github.com/RDMsmartnetworks/STM32_HAL_RNDIS",
