  "description": "Edited source of the eZ430-Chronos development kit. Some changes for smaller space. Designed with the 16KB limit of CCS in mind. Slide rule with 24 functions. Utility to reduce button pressing by hiding remote functions. Simple things until the memory is full. Any feature request should be raised as an issue. I have a Raspberry Pi and so I'm thinking of interoperation uses.",
